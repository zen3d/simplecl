(defn compile-pipeline
  "Takes a sequence of declarative CL processing/kernel or buffer steps, weaves and
  compiles them for later execution on a command queue using `enqueue` or
  `execute-pipeline` fns. Returns a map of queued items, set of all buffers
  and the final output buffer.
  Each step assumes either a buffer read/write op or a kernel definition with a
  single input and optional output buffer. For kernels each step also defines
  arguments and an output buffer. The last output buffer of the most recent kernel
  step acts as the default input, but can be overwritten. The first step requires
  an explicit `:in` definition. By default each step will also associate itself with
  the current `*program*`, but can refer to another program via an id and a given
  map of program ids and their CLProgram instances.

  Kernel steps are defined as maps with the same keys as required for `init-kernel`,
  however with some keys injected/manipulated automatically. Steps can also
  refer to previous steps in order to re-use outputs of a step which is not its
  direct predecessor.

      :id - id for this processing step (defaults to value of step's kernel :name)
      :in - vector of input buffer items, each one of:
            1) id of a previous step to re-use its last output buffer as input
            2) vector of [id type index] to refer to specific buffer of a previous
               step, where type is either :in/:out
            3) CLBuffer instance or buffer definition map (required for first step)
      :program - (optional) id of a program defined in the :programs map

  Each step can also optionally trigger the async writing or blocking reading
  of its associated buffers. This is done via the `:read` and `:write` vectors
  with `:in` or `:out` as their values. E.g. `:write [:in :out]` triggers the
  async writing of that step's input and output buffers *prior* to queuing the
  kernel. `:read [:out]` *must* be present for the last processing step and
  triggers the reading of its output (reads are always synchronous and are
  queued *after* kernel execution).

  To queue the reading or writing of additional buffers, define a step without
  a `:name` key and supply one or more CLBuffer instances for `:read` or `:write`:

      {:write [a b] :read c}

  Buffers queued in this way *cannot* be referenced later and are merely injected
  into the compiled pipeline."

(defn flipflop
  "Helper function for use with `compile-pipeline` to support kernels which

  buffer (before any already existing inputs) and using `out` as output buffer.
  All odd repetitions use the opposite behavior with `out` injected as first
  input and using `in` as output buffer for this step. This allows for the
  repeated application of a kernel without having to copy intermediate results.
